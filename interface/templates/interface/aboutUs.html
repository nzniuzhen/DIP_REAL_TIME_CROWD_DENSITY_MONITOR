    <p class="lead justify text-break text-">
        We’re a group of students wanting to provide the best experience for staffs and students in NTU. Crowd control is very important since the start of COVID-19 and we want to introduce to you what we can do to help everyone practice social distancing. Rather than walking all the way from one end to another finding that your destination’s capacity has reach it’s maximum, users can check on the EXACT amount of people using our website with just one simple click using their smartphones.

    <h4>What is this project about?</h4>
    <p class="lead justify text-break text-">
        This project aims to introduce a Real Time Crowd Density Monitor using a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is a small digital device capable of storing and processing images (with the aid of a high shuttle speed camera) then converting them into data using programming language instantaneously. This project not only eliminates the need for individuals to physically check in, it also provides up-to-the-minute information on the human crowd size. This helps to prevent overcrowding which aligns to the Singapore Government’s advocacy on social distancing. The project plans to design the device in three different stages, firstly the physical set up of the device, secondly the front-end and back-end coding and lastly user interface creation.
